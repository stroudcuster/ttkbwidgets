This is a small collection of ttkbootstrap based widgets I developed while coding the biometrics_tracker project.

+ DateWidget and TimeWidget allow the entry of a date of time without any pop-up calendars or clocks, which in my opinion
are just in the way most of the time, particularly for date-of-birth applications.

+ Checkbutton and Radiobutton provide clear visual feedback as to their focus and checked/unchecked states.  The standard versions don't change appearance when they are in focus.

+ TextWidget, IntegerWidget and DecimalWidget are validated by regular expressions, allowing a fine level of control of allowed input.

+ LabeledTextWidget, LabeledIntegerWidget and LabeledDecimal widget combine the three widgets listed above with a label, which can get placed in any position relative to the entry field.
